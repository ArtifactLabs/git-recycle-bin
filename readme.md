# What?
This project provides means for pushing artifacts from a git source repo to a git binary repo.

Say you/CI build an app; now you can publish your binary to git! Not to your same source code repo, but another *binary* repo.


# Why?
Unlike many artifact management systems out there, the artifacts published here will:
 - Have full traceability back to their original source code.
- Support expiry and garbage collection - achieved via git gc of orphan branches with absolute expiry date in their ref.
- Prolong expiry (absolute or indefinite) via simple git commands.
- Permit discoverability of available artifacts via `git notes`.
  Implemented as described in [issue #1](issues/0001-git-notes-integration.md).


# Usage
* Locally or CI-side, this tool creates and pushes artifacts, see `--help` and examples below.
* Garbage collection of expired artifacts is done at server-side.


## Schema
Artifacts come with meta-data, for {expiry, traceability, audit, placement} purposes. \
Meta-data is stored as trailer fields in the commit message, forming a schema, e.g.:

* `artifact-schema-version: 1` : Integer. The version of the schema.
* `artifact-name: Aurora-RST-Documentation` : String. Name of the artifact.
* `artifact-mime-type: directory` : String or tuple. MIME type of the artifact.
  - One of {[`mimetypes.guess_type()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/mimetypes.html#mimetypes.guess_type), `directory`, `link`, `mount`, `unknown`}.
* `artifact-tree-prefix: obj/doc/html` : String. Files in this artifact commit all share this directory-prefix.
  - Either `.` or some directory-prefix. (A directory-prefix can make merges of artifact-commits conflict-free)
* `src-git-relpath: ../obj/doc/html` : String. Relative path to artifact from source-git's root.
  - Leading `../ ` means artifact resided outside the source-git.
* `src-git-commit-title: rf: twister wrapper WIP` : String. Artifact was built from this commit in source git repo.
* `src-git-commit-sha: ed6267ee5b84c894fc8490d93db0525fb2f167eb` : String. Artifact was built from this commit in source git repo.
* `src-git-commit-changeid: Ie3eb7af86c3e578d2c18631f15cf0a12e7d0f80d` : String. Artifact was built from this commit in source git repo. Optional.
* `src-git-commit-time-author: Wed, 21 Jun 2023 14:13:31 +0200` : Date. Artifact was built from this commit in source git repo.
* `src-git-commit-time-commit: Wed, 21 Jun 2023 15:42:49 +0200` : Date. Artifact was built from this commit in source git repo.
* `src-git-branch: feature/wrk_le_audio_7.0` : String. Locally-checked out branch in source git repo or `Detached HEAD`.
* `src-git-repo-name: firmware` : String. Basename of `src-git-repo-url`.
* `src-git-repo-url: ssh://gerrit.ci.demant.com:29418/firmware` : String. URL of remote in source git repo.
* `src-git-commits-ahead: ?`: Integer or `?`. How many commits source git repo branch was locally ahead of its remote upstream tracking branch.
* `src-git-commits-behind: ?`: Integer or `?`. How many commits source git repo branch was locally behind of its remote upstream tracking branch.
* `src-git-status: clean` : String or strings. Either `clean` or list of locally {modified, deleted} files in source git repo. Untracked files are ignored.

This scheme captures only what is intrinsically tied to the artifact and the sources it comes from.
Adding further meta-data should be carefully considered, so as to not compromise the repeatability/_stability_ of the artifact's commit SHA.


### Other schema ideas
It may be tempting to extend the schema above with further convenient meta-data, see below for more ideas.
However, adding such _convenient_ meta-data means we mix-in ever-changing non-reproducible machine-specific side-effects - making the SHA _unstable_.
These could still be useful but do no belong in the artifact's commit message; would fit better as a `git-note` attached to the artifact's commitish or treeish -- this remains as possible future work.

* `artifact-outputs`: List of files/artifacts generated. Would give more insight into what's included beyond just the tree prefix.
* `artifact-dependencies`: List of other artifacts this one depends on. Useful for dependency management.
* `build-job`: ID of any associated CI job/build pipeline.
* `build-host`: Name/ID of machine that built the artifact.
* `build-duration`: How long the build took. Performance metric.
* `build-timestamp`: Exact UTC timestamp of when build occurred.
* `artifact-hash`: Hash or checksum of the artifact output. Improves integrity checking.
* `artifact-url`: Direct URL to download the artifact.
* `artifact-notes`: Any other information about the build - logs, warnings, etc.





# Usage example 1
```
git_recycle_bin.py \
    --path ../obj/doc/html \
    --name "Aurora-RST-Documentation" \
    --remote git@gitlab.ci.demant.com:csfw/documentation/generated/aurora_rst_html_mpeddemo.git \
    --push \
    --push-tag
```

This will:

  1. Create a new empty git repo locally -- to ensure non-interference with source repo.
  2. Create a new binary artifact git commit for the HTML folder and assign it a {name, expiry} and record meta-data.
  3. Push the artifact to the remote, as an orphan branch named `auto/artifact/firmware@ed6267ee5b84c894fc8490d93db0525fb2f167eb/{obj/doc/html}`
     (if the branch already exists, we lost the push-race and leave it alone).
  4. Push {a new, an update of} tag `auto/artifact/firmware@feature/wrk_le_audio_7.0/{obj/doc/html}`
     (if the tag already exists, it will be updated if our committer time is more recent).
